## Usage

### ES6/JSX (Recommended)
The component is written using ES6/JSX therefore Babel is required to directly use it. The below example is based on using [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) and [babel-loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader).

### Webpack Configuration
This module is designed to be used with webpack but requires a few loaders.

```shell
npm install webpack babel-loader css-loader style-loader postcss-loader extract-text-webpack-plugin --save-dev
```

Below are is a sample of how to setup the loaders:

```js
/**
 * Relevant Webpack Configuration
 */
{
  [...]
  module: {
    loaders: [
      // Setup support for ES6
      {
        test: /\.(jsx?|es6)$/,
        exclude: /(node_modules|bower_components)/,
        loader: 'babel'
      },
      // Setup support for CSS Modules
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        loader: ExtractTextPlugin.extract('style-loader', 'css-loader?modules&importLoaders=1&localIdentName=[name]__[local]___[hash:base64:5]!postcss-loader')
      }
    ]
  },
  plugins: [
    // Extract the css and put it in one file. Path is relative to output path
    new ExtractTextPlugin('../css/[name]-modules.css', { allChunks: true })
  ],
  [...]
}
```
